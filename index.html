        <h2>MemoryCompanion</h2>
        <p>A published research project that builds a next-generation digital health platform for Alzheimer’s care, integrating fine-tuned GPT-3.5 Turbo, voice cloning, and facial animation to deliver personalized, emotionally resonant support for AD patients.</p>
        <p>Developed on top of open-source models, <b>MemoryCompanion</b> replicates the voice and persona of familiar individuals to enable human-like conversations tailored to each patient’s memory profile—reducing social isolation and cognitive stress. The project was presented at <b>ML4H (Machine Learning for Health @ NeurIPS)</b> 2023, <b>QUWA: Sustainable Women Empowerment in Research and Innovation</b> (2023), and the <b>NYU Abu Dhabi AI Workshop</b> (2024). </p> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14730">Published Paper</a></p>

        <h2>Oscar Film Trend</h2>
        <p>A data analysis on the thematic evolution and depiction of societal issues in Oscar-winning films from 1927 to 2021, questioning a gradual uptick in social inclusiveness and diversity.</p>
        <p>Utilizing web-scraping techniques, data was harvested from Wikipedia and Rotten Tomatoes, concentrating on plots and reviews of Best Picture awardees.</p>

          <p><strong>Plot Analysis</strong>: Employing the 'stm' library in R for Structural Topic Modeling (STM) alongside textnets for plot summary analysis, we identified 10 predominant themes such as Crime, Family, War, and Empire. Despite a clear genre preference, a decrease in Love-themed movies was noted. Through textnets, thematic interconnections across decades were unveiled, suggesting avenues for deeper future investigations into these linkages.</p>
          <p><strong>Review Analysis</strong>: Differentiating between audience and critic reviews unveiled distinct preferences: audiences often discussed actors and filmic elements generically, whereas critics delved into technical merits and realism. Contrary to expectations, reviews trended towards casual recommendations rather than analytical deep dives.</p>

      <!-- Political Preference -->
      <div id="politics" class="project-detail hidden">
        <h2>Predicting Political Preferences</h2>
        <p>Built a supervised machine learning pipeline to classify political stance (Democrat vs. Republican) using 2020 U.S. election tweets. Our model combines sentiment analysis and topic frequency features to identify user alignment based on tweet content.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Data Source</b>: 1.72M tweets with #JoeBiden and #DonaldTrump hashtags from Kaggle (due to API limitations).</li>
          <li><b>Preprocessing</b>: Used spaCy for lemmatization and political topic detection across 17 manually-curated categories (e.g., abortion, economy, healthcare).</li>
          <li><b>Feature Engineering</b>: Constructed frequency vectors per topic; sentiment scores computed with VADER were used to weight each topic's presence per tweet.</li>
          <li><b>Modeling</b>: Trained multiple binary classifiers (SVC, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-NN). Best accuracy achieved: <b>57.22%</b>, aligning with prior research given the ambiguity of moderate political tweets.</li>       
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Key insights:</strong> Removing zero-sentiment tweest improved model accuracy by ~6%. Topic weighting via sentiment did not outperform unweighted topic frequency vectors. Classification accuracy was significantly better for extreme political tweets, consistent with literature findings.</p>

        <h2>Reciple Grandma</h2>
        <p>A mobile app to recommend recipes based on ingredients you already have.</p>
        <p>This application stands out by providing a user-friendly platform where individuals can effortlessly receive tailored recipe recommendations by simply inputting their available ingredients.</p>
        <p>Coded in JavaScript, this initiative spans the full stack of development, utilizing a robust stack of technologies including JavaScript, MongoDB, Nodemon, Docker, among others, to build a seamless and interactive application. <a href="https://github.com/yeonieheoo/final-project-team-recipe-grandma">GitHub Repo</a></p>

      <div id="proximity" class="project-detail hidden">
        <h2>Proximity</h2>
        <p>A GPS-based business model platform to connect student-run businesses with nearby customers.</p>
        <p>This initiative was born out of a keen observation of the struggles faced by students eager to offer their skills and services for a modest fee, yet hampered by the difficulty of finding sufficient clientele. Recognizing this gap, I embarked on an extensive journey that included thorough industry and market research, the development of user hypotheses, and an in-depth analysis of the strategic landscape, encompassing industry and market forces as well as key trends.</p>
        <img src="images/Proximity_1.png" alt="Proximity 1" class="centered-image"/>
        <img src="images/Proximity_2.png" alt="Proximity 2" class="centered-image"/>
        <p>The core objective of Proximity is to facilitate a seamless connection between student entrepreneurs and customers, thereby enabling students to find a wider audience for their services and products. Our platform not only helps these budding businesses increase their deal flow through strategic success management but also provides customers with easy access to a varied range of products and services at competitive prices and with rapid transaction times. What sets Proximity apart in a crowded marketplace is its seller-centric approach, offering a diverse selection of items ranging from handmade crafts to pre-loved goods.</p>
        <p>As we gear up for launch, our initial focus is on engaging NYU Abu Dhabi students, with plans to extend our reach to adjacent universities through a meticulously planned ambassador program.</p>
